        because the algorithm checks to see if the path is in collision,
        in which case it is discarded.

        However, in the case of the nonholonomic bicycle model, it will
        be very difficult for you to come up with a complete plan from c1
        to c2. Instead, you should choose a set of "motion-primitives", and
        then simply return whichever motion primitive brings you closest to c2.

        A motion primitive is just some small, local motion, that we can perform
        starting at c1. If we keep a set of these, we can choose whichever one
        brings us closest to c2.

        Keep in mind that choosing this set of motion primitives is tricky.
        Every plan we come up with will just be a bunch of these motion primitives
        chained together, so in order to get a complete motion planner, you need to 
        ensure that your set of motion primitives is such that you can get from any
        point to any other point using those motions.

        For example, in cartesian space, a set of motion primitives could be 
        {a1*x, a2*y, a3*z} where a1*x means moving a1 units in the x direction and
        so on. By varying a1, a2, a3, we get our set of primitives, and as you can
        see this set of primitives is rich enough that we can, indeed, get from any
        point in cartesian space to any other point by chaining together a bunch
        of these primitives. Then, this local planner would just amount to picking 
        the values of a1, a2, a3 that bring us closest to c2.

        You should spend some time thinking about what motion primitives would
        be good to use for a bicycle model robot. What kinds of motions are at
        our disposal?
